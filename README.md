Matlab-AVL-Wrapper
==================
The goal is to create a Matlab wrapper for AVL that generated an aero table for any given .avl file; the idea is to reproduce a wind tunnel simulation with alpha, beta, and deflection sweeps.

A motivation for this project is to get a HANDLE on Matlab GUI building as well. Not sure if I want to use GUIDE or just uicontrols, but it would be nice to be able to script calls to the functions, and not solely rely on the GUI.

## Objective
[![AVL](https://github.com/brio50/Matlab-AVL-Wrapper/raw/master/ref/AVL.png)](https://github.com/brio50/Matlab-AVL-Wrapper/raw/master/ref/AVL.pdf)
